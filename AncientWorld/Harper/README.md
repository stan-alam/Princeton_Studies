### The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire
```ascii

Here is the monumental retelling of one of the most consequential chapters 
of human history: the fall of the Roman Empire. The Fate of Rome is the first 
book to examine the catastrophic role that climate change and infectious diseases 
played in the collapse of Rome’s power—a story of nature’s triumph over human 
ambition. Interweaving a grand historical narrative with cutting-edge climate 
science and genetic discoveries, Kyle Harper traces how the fate of Rome was decided 
not just by emperors, soldiers, and barbarians but also by volcanic eruptions, solar cycles, 
climate instability, and devastating viruses and bacteria. 
The Fate of Rome is a sweeping account of how one of history’s greatest 
civilizations encountered and endured, yet ultimately succumbed to, 
the cumulative burden of nature’s violence.
